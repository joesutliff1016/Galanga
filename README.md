# Galanga is a Thai restaurant website built in React. This application uses a Firebase Nosql database that allows the site owner to sign in to an administrator page within their site and make changes to their menu, and have the changes go live immediately. I chose this project because I wanted to gain some real experience with building a content management system within React.
